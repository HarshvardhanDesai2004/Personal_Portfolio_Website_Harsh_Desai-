    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with Honours in
      Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at KIT College of Engineering 
      and technology Kolhapur. I come from a small town called Uttur in Kolhapur 
      district, where my curiosity for technology and problem-solving began at 
      an early age.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey has helped me build a strong foundation in programming
      languages such as C, C++, Java, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. Along with academics, I have gained hands-on experience through
      internships in Full Stack Development, Android Development, and Generative AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy building real-world applications that create impact and solve
      meaningful problems. Beyond technical skills, my experience as a Placement
      Coordinator and Technical Lead has strengthened my leadership, communication,
      and teamwork abilities. I am always eager to learn new technologies and grow
      as a developer.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Intelligent Job Fit Analyzer</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a web-based application that recommends suitable job roles
        based on a user's interests and skill assessment. The system collects
        user preferences through interactive forms and evaluates skills using
        a test-based approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built REST APIs to process results and generate personalized job
        recommendations, including suggested companies, learning resources,
        and improvement areas. This project strengthened my backend logic,
        API design, and frontend integration skills.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Responsive Doctor Appointment Portal</h3>
      <p>
        Designed and developed a responsive web portal that allows users to
        book doctor appointments based on real-time availability. Implemented
        secure authentication and real-time database integration for managing
        bookings efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portal supports doctor-based, hospital-based, and symptom-based
        search options, along with automatic email notifications after booking.
        This project improved my understanding of user experience, responsive
        design, and real-time applications.
